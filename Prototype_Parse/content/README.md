This folder contains the descritption of the nodes and the links between them.
Each node and the links that derivate from him are represented in a different txt file.
Requirements for the txt files are as follows:

-file name begins by "node"
-node name follows the tag "NAME = ".
Node name can only be composed of latin letters, numbers and '_' symbols (no space).
-node text is composed of one or several paragraphs, each one following the tag "PAR = ".
Do not use "newline" within a paragraph.
-links between the node described and other nodes are indicated by "LINK = <link description> ---<name of linked node>".
This format forbids to use "---" in the link descriptions of node names.

For any question, please refer to the template or ask Louis Dumont.
